# Assignment Readme

This assignment involves creating a cron job to check if Chrome is running every 30 minutes. If found, it will be terminated, and the result will be logged to `/var/record.txt`. Additionally, a `KillAll.sh` script is provided for general application termination. Exercise caution when killing processes and test in a controlled environment before production use.

**Note:** Review the `KillAll.sh` script for a general implementation to terminate applications and log results. Exercise caution when killing processes and test in a controlled environment before production use.
